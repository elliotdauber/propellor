In some cases, there may even be multiple words together in the source text that should form a proper noun. You should use the context of the surrounding words, as well as the context object I will provide you, to determine what the proper nouns might be. As stated, you will also receive as input a context object in JSON format, which you must use to make even better guesses. This will tell you what proper nouns have already been identified previously, and what they were corrected to. Weigh this context heavily in your decisions.
